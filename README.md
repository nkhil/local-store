# Local store

Experimenting using reducers alongside the context API as a replacement for using Redux to manage state, as well as experimenting storing state in a browser's localStorage. This is the first attempt at building a react app without any prop drilling (and without using Redux, which I'm unfamiliar with as of May 2, 2020).

This repository was built trying out ideas from Cassidy William's [Pluralsight webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrmpUCpmawg). You can find her original repo [here](https://github.com/cassidoo/reading-challenge-webinar).

## This repo is also a proof of concept

This is also a proof of concept app for a system to order groceries, without involving payments.
